        outline: Opokuya and Kubi lived on Sweet Breezes Hill, once the most prestigious colonial residential area. They resided in the same old colonial surveyorâ€™s bungalow built in the 1930s, where Opokuya was acutely aware of the various spirits inhabiting the house. These spirits included that of the first surveyor, likely the one who selected the hill for occupation, and the English civil servants sent to administer the territories and civilize the natives. The natives, both along the Guinea coast and in the country's interior, were considered some of the rudest and most untameable within the British Empire, though the reason for this reputation remained unknown. Over time, a significant number of Englishmen had arrived, accompanied by their women.
        description: This passage provides a vivid depiction of the historical and colonial context surrounding Opokuya and Kubi's residence on Sweet Breezes Hill. The colonial surveyor's bungalow reflects the enduring colonial legacy, the house serving as a tangible reminder of the colonial era's architecture and influence. Opokuya's spiritual awareness adds an element of mysticism and cultural belief, highlighting the spiritual connection to the land and its history. Colonization is depicted to be superior and to have a paternalistic attitude towards indigenous populations. It also touches on the challenges faced by the colonial administration in dealing with the perceived "rudeness" and "untameable" nature of the local population, reflecting colonial stereotypes and prejudices. Overall, the passage offers a nuanced portrayal of the colonial legacy and its impact on African society and culture.
